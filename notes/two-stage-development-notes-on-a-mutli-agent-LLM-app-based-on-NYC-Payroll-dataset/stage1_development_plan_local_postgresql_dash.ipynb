    "# Stage 1 Development Plan: Local PostgreSQL and Dash\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Before obtaining access to the relevant Tableau APIs (through receiving a token or verification code), set up a local PostgreSQL database and use Dash for data visualization to analyze the NYC Payroll dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Set Up PostgreSQL Database\n",
    "- Install PostgreSQL locally. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Create a new database for the NYC Payroll dataset. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Define the schema for the dataset and create the necessary tables. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Import the cleaned and preprocessed dataset into the PostgreSQL database. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\n",
    "- Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Perform data cleaning operations (e.g., handling missing values, correcting data types). **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Normalize and transform data as needed. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Export the cleaned data to CSV files for import into PostgreSQL. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Use SQL queries to perform initial data exploration. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Identify key features and metrics for further analysis. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Visualize data distributions and relationships using pandas and matplotlib. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Develop Dash Application\n",
    "- Install Dash and its dependencies. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Create a basic Dash app structure. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Connect the Dash app to the PostgreSQL database. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Develop interactive visualizations for key metrics and features. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Implement user input controls for dynamic data filtering and analysis. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Develop Multi-Agent LLM Application\n",
    "- Design the architecture of the multi-agent system. **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "- Implement individual agents for specific tasks (e.g., data analysis, reporting). **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "- Integrate the agents to work collaboratively on the dataset. **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "- Develop a user interface for interaction with the multi-agent system. **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "- Allow users to access the LLM app through the interactive Dash app. **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Testing and Validation\n",
    "- Test the Dash app for functionality and performance. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Validate the accuracy of the visualizations and data analysis. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Test the multi-agent LLM application for reliability and performance. **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "- Gather feedback and make necessary improvements. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "By following this development plan, we will establish a robust foundation for analyzing the NYC Payroll dataset using a local PostgreSQL database and Dash for interactive data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will set the stage for a seamless, \"out of the box\" integration with the Tableau/Salesforce ecosystem through its relevant APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal is to provide the same, perhaps richer user experience of the LLM app on Tableau.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the code implementation plan of the multi-agent LLM app, refer to the [code implementation roadmap notebook](./code_implementation_stage1_local_postgresql_dash.ipynb)."
