    "# Code Implementation Roadmap: Stage 1 - Local PostgreSQL and Dash\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Before obtaining access to the relevant Tableau APIs (through receiving a token or verification code), set up a local PostgreSQL database and use Dash for data visualization to analyze the NYC Payroll dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Set Up PostgreSQL Database\n",
    "- Install PostgreSQL locally. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Create a new database for the NYC Payroll dataset. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Define the schema for the dataset and create the necessary tables. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Import the cleaned and preprocessed dataset into the PostgreSQL database. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\n",
    "- Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Perform data cleaning operations (e.g., handling missing values, correcting data types). **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Normalize and transform data as needed. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Export the cleaned data to CSV files for import into PostgreSQL. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Use SQL queries to perform initial data exploration. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Identify key features and metrics for further analysis. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Visualize data distributions and relationships using pandas and matplotlib. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Develop Dash Application\n",
    "- Install Dash and its dependencies. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Create a basic Dash app structure. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Connect the Dash app to the PostgreSQL database. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Develop interactive visualizations for key metrics and features. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Implement user input controls for dynamic data filtering and analysis. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Testing and Validation\n",
    "- Test the Dash app for functionality and performance. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Validate the accuracy of the visualizations and data analysis. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "- Gather feedback and make necessary improvements. **(Implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "By following this development plan, we will establish a robust foundation for analyzing the NYC Payroll dataset using a local PostgreSQL database and Dash for interactive data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will set the stage for a seamless, \"out of the box\" integration with the Tableau/Salesforce ecosystem through its relevant APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal is to provide the same, perhaps richer user experience of the LLM app on Tableau."
