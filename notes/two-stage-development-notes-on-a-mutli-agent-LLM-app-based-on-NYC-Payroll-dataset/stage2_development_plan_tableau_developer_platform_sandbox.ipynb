    "# Stage 2 Development Plan: Tableau Developer Platform and Sandbox\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Leverage the Tableau Developer Platform and Sandbox environment to integrate the multi-agent LLM application with Tableau for enhanced data visualization and user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Set Up Tableau Developer Account\n",
    "- Sign up for a Tableau Developer account.\n",
    "- Obtain the necessary API keys and tokens for accessing Tableau services.\n",
    "- Familiarize yourself with the Tableau Developer Platform documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Prepare the Sandbox Environment\n",
    "- Set up a Tableau Sandbox environment for development and testing.\n",
    "- Import the NYC Payroll dataset into Tableau.\n",
    "- Create initial visualizations and dashboards to understand Tableau's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Develop Integration with Multi-Agent LLM Application\n",
    "- Design the integration architecture between the multi-agent LLM application and Tableau. **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "- Implement API calls to fetch data from the PostgreSQL database and send it to Tableau. **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "- Develop custom Tableau extensions or connectors if necessary. **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Enhance Data Visualizations\n",
    "- Utilize Tableau's advanced visualization features to create interactive and insightful dashboards. **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "- Implement user input controls and filters to allow dynamic data exploration. **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "- Ensure that the visualizations are responsive and user-friendly. **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Testing and Validation\n",
    "- Test the integration thoroughly to ensure data accuracy and performance. **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "- Validate the functionality of the multi-agent LLM application within the Tableau environment. **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "- Gather feedback from users and make necessary improvements. **(To be implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "By following this development plan, we will successfully integrate the multi-agent LLM application with the Tableau Developer Platform, providing enhanced data visualization and user interaction capabilities. This will enable users to leverage the full potential of the NYC Payroll dataset within the Tableau ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the code implementation plan of the multi-agent LLM app, refer to the [code implementation roadmap notebook](./code_implementation_stage2_tableau_developer_platform_sandbox.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Allow users to access the LLM app through the interactive Dash app."
