    "# Summary of Two-Stage Development Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stage 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing\n",
    "- Collect the NYC Payroll dataset.\n",
    "- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n",
    "- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.\n",
    "- Identify key features and metrics relevant to the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stage 2: Multi-Agent LLM Application Development\n",
    "- Design the architecture of the multi-agent system.\n",
    "- Implement individual agents for specific tasks (e.g., data analysis, reporting).\n",
    "- Integrate the agents to work collaboratively on the dataset.\n",
    "- Develop a user interface for interaction with the multi-agent system.\n",
    "- Test the application thoroughly to ensure reliability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This two-stage development plan outlines the steps necessary to build a robust multi-agent LLM application based on the NYC Payroll dataset. By following this plan, we aim to create a system that can efficiently analyze and report on payroll data."
